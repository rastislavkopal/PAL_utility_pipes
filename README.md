# Utility Pipes
 There are two kinds of agricultural farms in the area - bigger farms, called hub farms, and smaller farms, called subject farms.
 Some pairs of farms are connected by roads and each subject farm is accessible from at least one hub farm by a sequence of one or more roads.
 A network of utility pipes is going to be built in the area. All hub farms are already connected to the state backbone utility grid, and none of the subject farms is connected to it.
 The proposed network will connect each subject farm to exactly one hub farm by a sequence of one or more pipes. Each pipe will connect two farms and it will be laid by the road connecting the farms, thus, its length will be the same as the length of the road.
 To keep the network scheme simple, it was decided that each subject farm will be connected to its closest hub farm. The distance between two farms is always equal to the minimum total length of roads that have to be traversed when traveling from one farm to the other one. All roads are two-way roads.
 It was soon pointed out by the oponents of the project there there may be some subject farms for which there exist two or more closest hub farms. Project managers therefore decided to call such farms undecided farms and exclude them from the project altogether, if they will be revealed in the area. A separate project regarding their connection to the network would be proposed later.
 
 An obvious demand of the management and the farmers is to lay pipes in optimal way, that is, to minimize their total length.
